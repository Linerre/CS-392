# Compiling & Linking

Compiling is a process that transforms computer code written in one programming language (the source language) into another programming language (the target language).

## Compiling step by step

- The compiler pre-processes the directives by expanding `#include` and `#define`. 
- The preprocessed code is translated into assembly code which is then *assembled* into machine code.
- Object files are linked together to produce the final executable.

```bash
# main.c -> main.i -> main.s -> main.o
gcc -E main.c -o main.i
gcc -S main.i -o main.s
gcc main.s -o main.o
```

## Compiling with multiple files

Compiling is performed for each individual source file to produce **relocatable** object files which are then linked together to produce a single executable object file. 

*Linkers* are used to create modularity between code, thus a program can be written as a collectoin of smaller source files rather than one monolithic mass. Libraries of common functions can also be built due to this modular property. Modular code is also more *efficent* for both time and space. 

Since source files can be compiled separately (change one source file, compile, and then relink) modular code will compile faster. Additionally, library functions can be aggregated into a single file yet executable files and running memory images contain only code for the functions they actually use.

## What does `Linker` do?

### Symbol Resolution

Programs define and reference symbols (global variables and functions):
```C
void swap() {}     // define symbol swap 
swap();            // reference symbol swap 
int *xp = &x;      // define symbol xp, reference x 
```

Symbol definitions are stored in object file (by assembler) in symbol table. The symbol table is an array of structs where each entry includes name, size, and location of symbol. During the symbol resolution step, the linker associates each symbol reference with exactly **one** symbol definition.

### Relocation & Symbol Rules

At a high level, all the objects are *relocated* to a final executable and symbols are resolved using the compiler's symbol rules.

Program symbols are either strong or weak. 
- *Strong*: procedures and initialized globals 
- *Weak*: uninitialized globals

- Rule 1: Multiple strong symbols are not allowed
  - Each item can be defined only once
  - Otherwise: `Linker error`
- Rule 2: Given a strong symbol and multiple weak symbols, choose the strong symbol
  - References to the weak symbol resolve to the strong symbol
- Rule 3: If there are multiple weak symbols, pick an arbitrary one
  - Can override this with `gcc â€“fno-common`
